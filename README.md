# theQuatBot ðŸ¤–

This a simple repository of a 'the bois' discord group chat bot, written in C#, using the DSharpPlus library to interact with the Discord API, don't know why you'd wanna look at some poorly made spaghetti code but eh it's here.

## Commands ðŸ–‹

There's quite a few random commands that are an inside joke to the group, but it's mostly just commands that are in already existing discord bots,, just mostly compiled into one and more to come definitely as well;

- `ping` - what bot got no ping cmd lmao; just returns     client ping
- `slap` - takes in a Discord Member and slapping them with a slapping emoji
- `summon` - summons a picture of a few of the bois and summoning
- `annoy` - basically a spam ping command to annoy someone 
- `avatar` - self explanatory
- `pain` - returns a beautiful poem abt pain. made by me friends
- `say` - dictate what the bot gon say
- `sayto` - dictate what the bot gonna say, just to a specified channel
- `8ball` - 8ball command to answer all those heart-aching questions we have
- `rps` - simple rps game with the bot
- `kanye` - returns a kanye quote taken from <https://kanye.rest/>
- `uptime` - returns uptime of bot,, more specifically uptime of console line running
- `purge` - self-explanatory,, deletes the intended amnt of msgs in a channel
- `wallhaven` - wallhaven cmd group to return a set of wallpapers preview from the [Wallhaven API](https://wallhaven.cc/help/api), with thanks to [WallpaperSharp Wrapper](https://github.com/realTobby/WallpaperSharp)

Expect more commands to come cos it's been fun making this for me friends, along the lines of more API calling and creating inside jokes commands,, like `stophorny` cmd to stop us being horny. Will add more stuff like having birthdays of the bois set up and saved in a json.

Just a side note, don't know why you're reading this, but glad you made it to the end, you can use this repos for some inspiration of commands if you're also making a discord bot using DSharpPlus, though don't recommend following exact code, but eh, nonetheless I appreciate you reading all this out and looking at this repos,, wtv your reason is.

Last thing, big thanks to [Dapper Dino](https://www.youtube.com/c/DapperDinoCodingTutorials) for his C# Discord bot tutorials, awesome work, and [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus) library for existing.
